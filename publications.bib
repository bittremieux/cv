  abstract = {The awareness that systematic quality control is an essential factor to enable the growth of proteomics into a mature analytical discipline has increased over the past few years. To this aim, a controlled vocabulary and document structure have recently been proposed by Walzer et al. to store and disseminate quality-control metrics for mass-spectrometry-based proteomics experiments, called qcML. To facilitate the adoption of this standardized quality control routine, we introduce jqcML, a Java application programming interface (API) for the qcML data format. First, jqcML provides a complete object model to represent qcML data. Second, jqcML provides the ability to read, write, and work in a uniform manner with qcML data from different sources, including the XML-based qcML file format and the relational database qcDB. Interaction with the XML-based file format is obtained through the Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB), while generic database functionality is obtained by the Java Persistence API (JPA). jqcML is released as open-source software under the permissive Apache 2.0 license and can be downloaded from https://bitbucket.org/proteinspector/jqcml.},

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, pattern mining techniques have become an integral part of many bioinformatics solutions. Frequent itemset mining is a popular group of pattern mining techniques designed to identify elements that frequently co-occur. An archetypical example is the identification of products that often end up together in the same shopping basket in supermarket transactions. A number of algorithms have been developed to address variations of this computationally non-trivial problem. Frequent itemset mining techniques are able to efficiently capture the characteristics of (complex) data and succinctly summarize it. Owing to these and other interesting properties, these techniques have proven their value in biological data analysis. Nevertheless, information about the bioinformatics applications of these techniques remains scattered. In this primer, we introduce frequent itemset mining and their derived association rules for life scientists. We give an overview of various algorithms, and illustrate how they can be used in several real-life bioinformatics application domains. We end with a discussion of the future potential and open challenges for frequent itemset mining in the life sciences.},

This technical note introduces a strategy based on a minimum shared peak count between two spectra to reduce the set of admissible candidate spectra when issuing a query. A theoretical validation through time complexity analysis and an experimental validation based on an implementation of the candidate reduction strategy show that the approach can achieve a reduction of the set of candidate spectra by (at least) an order of magnitude, resulting in a significant improvement in the speed of the search. Meanwhile, more than 99\% of the positive search results is retained. This efficient strategy to drastically improve the speed of spectral library searching with a negligible loss of sensitivity can be applied to any current spectral library search tool, irrespective of the employed similarity metric.},

  abstract = {Over the past few years, awareness has risen that for mass-spectrometry-based proteomics methods to mature into everyday analytical and clinical practices, extensive quality assessment is mandatory. A currently overlooked source of qualitative information originates from the mass spectrometer itself. Apart from the actual mass spectral data, raw-data objects also contain parameter settings and sensory information about the mass instrument. This information gives a detailed account of the operation of the instrument, which eventually can be related to observations in mass spectral data. The advantage of instrument information at the lowest level is the high sensitivity to detect emerging defects in a timely fashion. To this end, we introduce the Instrument MONitoring DataBase (iMonDB), which allows us to automatically extract, store, and manage the instrument parameters from raw-data objects into a highly efficient database structure. This enables us to monitor the instrument parameters over a considerable time period. Time course information about the instrument performance is necessary to define the normal range of operation and to detect anomalies that may correlate with instrument failure. The proposed tools foster an additional handle on quality control and are released as open source under the permissive Apache 2.0 license.

To understand and evaluate how technical variability affects the results of an experiment, several computationally derived quality control metrics have been introduced. However, despite the availability of these metrics, a systematic approach to quality control is often still lacking because the metrics are not fully understood and hard to interpret. Here we present a toolkit of powerful techniques to analyze and interpret multivariate quality control metrics to assess the quality of mass spectrometry proteomics experiments. We show how unsupervised techniques applied to these quality control metrics can provide an initial discrimination between low-quality experiments and high-quality experiments prior to manual investigation. Furthermore, we provide a technique to obtain detailed information on the quality control metrics that are related to the decreased performance, which can be used as actionable information to improve the experimental setup.

The association between a subgraph pattern and a set of vertices is defined by its significant enrichment based on a Bonferroni-corrected hypergeometric probability value. This interestingness measure requires a dedicated pruning procedure to limit the number of subgraph matches that must be calculated. The presented mining algorithm to find associated subgraph patterns in large graphs is therefore designed to efficiently traverse the search space. We demonstrate the operation of this method by applying it on three biological graph data sets and show that we can find associated subgraphs for a biologically relevant set of vertices and that the found subgraphs themselves are biologically interesting.},

For this purpose the previously proposed qcML format will be adapted to support a variety of use cases for both proteomics and metabolomics applications, and it will be established as an official PSI format. An important consideration is to avoid enforcing restrictive requirements on quality control, but instead provide the basic technical necessities required to support extensive quality control for any type of mass spectrometry-based workflow.

They typically focus on, and are able to, accurately predict peptide binding and presentation by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. However, recognition of the peptide-MHC complex by a T-cell receptor is often not included in these tools. We developed a classification approach based on random forest classifiers to predict recognition of a peptide by a T-cell and discover patterns that contribute to recognition. We considered two approaches to solve this problem: (1) distinguishing between two sets of T-cell receptors that each bind to a known peptide and (2) retrieving T-cell receptors that bind to a given peptide from a large pool of T-cell receptors. Evaluation of the models on two HIV-1, B*08-restricted epitopes reveals good performance and hints towards structural CDR3 features that can determine peptide immunogenicity. These results are of particularly importance as they show that prediction of T-cell epitope and T-cell epitope recognition based on sequence data is a feasible approach. In addition, the validity of our models not only serves as a proof of concept for the prediction of immunogenic T-cell epitopes but also paves the way for more general and high performing models.},

  doi = {10.1101/134189},
  abstract = {Despite the increasing importance of non-targeted metabolomics to answer various life science questions, extracting biochemically relevant information from metabolomics spectral data is still an incompletely solved problem. Most computational tools to identify tandem mass spectra focus on a limited set of molecules of interest. However, such tools are typically constrained by the availability of reference spectra or molecular databases, limiting their applicability to identify unknown metabolites. In contrast, recent advances in the field illustrate the possibility to expose the underlying biochemistry without relying on metabolite identification, in particular via substructure prediction. We describe an automated method for substructure recommendation motivated by association rule mining. Our framework captures potential relationships between spectral features and substructures learned from public spectral libraries. These associations are used to recommend substructures for any unknown mass spectrum. Our method does not require any predefined metabolite candidates, and therefore it can be used for the partial identification of unknown unknowns. The method is called MESSAR (MEtabolite SubStructure Auto-Recommender) and is implemented in a free online web service available at messar.biodatamining.be.

Author Summary Mass spectrometry is one of most used techniques to detect and identify metabolites. However, learning metabolite structures directly from mass spectrometry data has always been a challenging task. Thousands of mass spectra from various biological systems still remain unanalyzed simply because no current bioinformatic tools are able to generate structural hypotheses. By manually studying mass spectra of standard compounds, chemists discovered that metabolites that share common substructures can also share spectral features. As data scientists, we believe that such relationships can be unraveled from massive structure and spectra data by machine learning. In this study, we adapted ‚Äúassociation rule mining‚Äù, traditionally used in market basket analysis, to structural and spectral data, allowing us to investigate all spectral features - metabolite substructures relationships. We further collected all statistically sound relationships into a database and used them to assign substructral hypotheses to unexplored spectra. We named our approach MESSAR, MEtabolite SubStructure Auto-Recommender, available to the metabolomics and mass spectrometry community as a free and open web service.},

This white paper is the direct result of a strategy meeting on ‚ÄòThe Future of Proteomics in ELIXIR‚Äô that took place in March 2017 in T√ºbingen (Germany), and involved representatives of eleven ELIXIR nodes.
 
These discussions led to a list of priority areas in computational proteomics that would complement existing activities and close gaps in the portfolio of tools and services offered by ELIXIR so far. We provide some suggestions on how these activities could be integrated into ELIXIR‚Äôs existing platforms, and how it could lead to a new ELIXIR use case in proteomics. We also highlight connections to the related field of metabolomics, where similar activities are ongoing. This white paper could thus serve as a starting point for the integration of computational proteomics into ELIXIR. Over the next few months we will be working closely with all stakeholders involved, and in particular with other representatives of the proteomics community, to further refine this paper.},

  abstract = {The Proteomics Standards Initiative (PSI) of the Human Proteome Organization (HUPO) has now been developing and promoting open community standards and software tools in the field of proteomics for 15 years. Under the guidance of the chair, cochairs, and other leadership positions, the PSI working groups are tasked with the development and maintenance of community standards via special workshops and ongoing work. Among the existing ratified standards, the PSI working groups continue to update PSI-MI XML, MITAB, mzML, mzIdentML, mzQuantML, mzTab, and the MIAPE (Minimum Information About a Proteomics Experiment) guidelines with the advance of new technologies and techniques. Furthermore, new standards are currently either in the final stages of completion (proBed and proBAM for proteogenomics results as well as PEFF) or in early stages of design (a spectral library standard format, a universal spectrum identifier, the qcML quality control format, and the Protein Expression Interface (PROXI) web services Application Programming Interface). In this work we review the current status of all of these aspects of the PSI, describe synergies with other efforts such as the ProteomeXchange Consortium, the Human Proteome Project, and the metabolomics community, and provide a look at future directions of the PSI.},

  abstract = {Open modification searching (OMS) is a powerful search strategy that identifies peptides carrying any type of modification by allowing a modified spectrum to match against its unmodified variant by using a very wide precursor mass window. A drawback of this strategy, however, is that it leads to a large increase in search time. Although performing an open search can be done using existing spectral library search engines by simply setting a wide precursor mass window, none of these tools have been optimized for OMS, leading to excessive runtimes and suboptimal identification results. We present the ANN-SoLo tool for fast and accurate open spectral library searching. ANN-SoLo uses approximate nearest neighbor indexing to speed up OMS by selecting only a limited number of the most relevant library spectra to compare to an unknown query spectrum. This approach is combined with a cascade search strategy to maximize the number of identified unmodified and modified spectra while strictly controlling the false discovery rate as well as a shifted dot product score to sensitively match modified spectra to their unmodified counterparts. ANN-SoLo achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of speed and the number of identifications. On a previously published human cell line data set, ANN-SoLo confidently identifies more spectra than SpectraST or MSFragger and achieves a speedup of an order of magnitude compared with SpectraST. ANN-SoLo is implemented in Python and C++. It is freely available under the Apache 2.0 license at https://github.com/bittremieux/ANN-SoLo.},

  abstract = {High-throughput T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing allows the characterization of an individual‚Äôs TCR repertoire and directly query their immune state. However, it remains a non-trivial task to couple these sequenced TCRs to their antigenic targets. In this paper, we present a novel strategy to annotate full TCR sequence repertoires. The strategy is based on a machine learning algorithm to learn the TCR patterns common to the recognition of a specific epitope. These results are then combined with a statistical analysis to evaluate the occurrence of specific epitope-reactive TCR sequences per epitope in repertoire data. In this manner, we can directly study the capacity of full TCR repertoires to target specific epitopes of the relevant vaccines or pathogens. We demonstrate the usability of this approach on three independent datasets related to vaccine monitoring and infectious disease diagnostics by independently identifying the epitopes that are targeted by the TCR repertoire.

Subgraph mining techniques focus on the discovery of patterns in graphs that exhibit a specific network structure that is deemed interesting within these data sets. The definition of which subgraphs are interesting and which are not is highly dependent on the application. These techniques have seen numerous applications and are able to tackle a range of biological research questions, spanning from the detection of common substructures in sets of biomolecular compounds, to the discovery of network motifs in large-scale molecular interaction networks. Thus far, information about the bioinformatics application of subgraph mining remains scattered over heterogeneous literature.

  abstract = {Data analysis for metabolomics is undergoing rapid progress thanks to the proliferation of novel tools and the standardization of existing workflows. As untargeted metabolomics datasets and experiments continue to increase in size and complexity, standardized workflows are often not sufficiently sophisticated. In addition, the ground truth for untargeted metabolomics experiments is intrinsically unknown and the performance of tools is difficult to evaluate. Here, the problem of dynamic multi-class metabolomics experiments was investigated using a simulated dataset with a known ground truth. This simulated dataset was used to evaluate the performance of tinderesting, a new and intuitive tool based on gathering expert knowledge to be used in machine learning. The results were compared to EDGE, a statistical method for time series data. This paper presents three novel outcomes. The first is a way to simulate dynamic metabolomics data with a known ground truth based on ordinary differential equations. This method is made available through the MetaboLouise R package. Second, the EDGE tool, originally developed for genomics data analysis, is highly performant in analyzing dynamic case vs. control metabolomics data. Third, the tinderesting method is introduced to analyse more complex dynamic metabolomics experiments. This tool consists of a Shiny app for collecting expert knowledge, which in turn is used to train a machine learning model to emulate the decision process of the expert. This approach does not replace traditional data analysis workflows for metabolomics, but can provide additional information, improved performance or easier interpretation of results. The advantage is that the tool is agnostic to the complexity of the experiment, and thus is easier to use in advanced setups. All code for the presented analysis, MetaboLouise and tinderesting are freely available.},

  abstract = {Open modification searching (OMS) is a powerful search strategy to identify peptides with any type of modification. OMS works by using a very wide precursor mass window to allow modified spectra to match against their unmodified variants, after which the modification types can be inferred from the corresponding precursor mass differences. A disadvantage of this strategy, however, is the large computational cost, because each query spectrum has to be compared against a multitude of candidate peptides.,We have previously introduced the ANN-SoLo tool for fast and accurate open spectral library searching. ANN-SoLo uses approximate nearest neighbor indexing to speed up OMS by selecting only a limited number of the most relevant library spectra to compare to an unknown query spectrum. Here we demonstrate how this candidate selection procedure can be further optimized using graphics processing units. Additionally, we introduce a feature hashing scheme to convert high-resolution spectra to low-dimensional vectors. Based on these algorithmic advances, along with low-level code optimizations, the new version of ANN-SoLo is up to an order of magnitude faster than its initial version. This makes it possible to efficiently perform open searches on a large scale to gain a deeper understanding about the protein modification landscape. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and identification performance of ANN-SoLo based on a large data set of the draft human proteome.,ANN-SoLo is implemented in Python and C++.

  abstract = {For the 2018 YPIC Challenge contestants were invited to try to decipher two unknown English questions encoded by a synthetic protein expressed in Escherichia coli. In addition to deciphering the sentence, contestants were asked to determine the 3D structure and determine any post-translation modifications left by the host organism. We present how we analyzed this unknown sample using a tryptic digest with dynamic exclusion disabled to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the measured molecules. Subsequently, spectral clustering was used to generate high-quality consensus spectra and condense the acquired MS/MS spectral data. De novo spectrum identification was used to determine the English questions encoded by the synthetic protein, and any post-translational modifications introduced by E. coli on the synthetic protein were detected using spectral networking. Although the synthetic protein sample for the 2018 YPIC Challenge is not of biological interest, the experimental and computational strategy presented here can be directly used to analyze samples for which no protein sequence information is available or when the identity of the sample is unknown. All software and code to perform the bioinformatics analysis is available as open source, and a self-contained Jupyter notebook is provided to fully recreate the analysis.},
